# Intermediate Javascript Assessments

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

.map() affects each element specifically in an array and will return the same number of elements. filter() will 'filter' out only the elements that meet our conditions

2. Why would you use object destructuring?

to create a sort of shortened version of your code so that you can increase the usability of key value pairs.

3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

var has global scope, let has local scope and const is a variable that can't be changed

4. Why is testing important?

it helps pinpoint where the issue is in the code so that when something breaks, you know how it breaks. it takes time up front to test but can actually be quicker down the road.

5. What is a higher order function?

functions that use other functions as arguments

6. What is the difference between a class and an object?

a class is the blueprint for an object

7. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

I learned that I need to spend a little more time studying/practicing javascript. While I'm doing okay, I felt a little behind compared to one of my partners and that was discouraging to say the least. I feel like I'm struggling with all of the terminology and applying it directly to the code. When I see it written out, it makes sense and I can certainly help troubleshoot and problem solve but I would just like to be a little more comfortable with JS

### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?

in the <head> of html you would enter:  <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "myStyle.css" /> (or whatever the title of your css file is)

2. What is the difference between a div and a span?

a div is typically going to be a larger piece of your page and will have multiple elements to it, whereas a span is a smaller piece of one specific section or line.

3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?

both class and id are attributes used to style in CSS. a class just isn't unique and can be used on multiple elements. id's are unique to only one element.

4. Name 4 semantic HTML tags.

<form>, <table>, <article>, <header>

5. What are three options for creating responsive design?

<width>, <picture>, <style>


### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?

front end development is anything that the user sees on a webpage ("user interface"). Tools would be HTML, CSS, JS, React.

2. What is block scope in JavaScript?

block scope allows for variables to be declared only in a local capacity and cannot be used outside of that function.

3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?

inheritance is the behavior and data from the parent that gets sent down to child classes, objects, elements, etc.
